        <h1>Five Years of Minetrack</h1><time>July 11, 2020</time></header><p>Over five years ago I quickly wrote and glued together <a href="https://minetrack.me">Minetrack</a> (originally &ldquo;FastTrack&rdquo; üôÉ). It was effectively an auto refreshing web version of the <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Menu_screen#Multiplayer">Minecraft multiplayer menu</a> used to display player counts.</p>

<p><strong>But why?</strong></p>
<p>It had a simple purpose: in an era of frequent <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/">DDoS attacks</a> on Minecraft servers, Minetrack offered an easy way to correlate player count shifts between competing Minecraft servers potentially suffering network issues.</p>
<p>Minetrack was not a new idea. Several sites already existed to track Minecraft server player counts, such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130718164208/http://www.topmcnetworks.com/">Top MC Networks</a>. However they focused on historical trends (5 minute update intervals) whereas Minetrack offered <em>real-ish</em> time 3 second update intervals. To help differentiate Minetrack (and avoid the nightmare of Javascript graphing libraries), I even refused to add a historical graph for over a year after release. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

<p><strong>Well&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>Minetrack was first and foremost, a tool designed for <em>me</em>. I offered it to others, and <a href="https://github.com/Cryptkeeper/Minetrack">open sourced its code</a>, but the design, feature set, and Minecraft servers it watched, were always reflective of my use case.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, people embraced its messy codebase and limited functionality. Soon after, people began adapting Minetrack to fit their own use cases.</p>
<p>Some people deployed their own Minetrack instance with a custom list of watched Minecraft servers. ‚¨áÔ∏è</p>

<p>Some people redesigned it.</p>

<p>Other people used it to monitor their internal infrastructure instead of public facing Minecraft servers.</p>

<p>Finally, some weird people decided to rip out the backend and plug in their own, repurposing the frontend.</p>

<p>Early on, there was even a (briefly working) Chrome extension built by a friend.</p>

<p>Slowly, various community bug reports and pull requests began to pop up.</p>
<p>I started to relax my tight grip on the project and focused on welcoming these incoming changes. Piece by piece Minetrack evolved from a quick hack into something useful for the larger community, even if it was just to see who&rsquo;s fault a lagging connection was.</p>
<p><strong>A Brief Timeline</strong></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>And with the exception of little tweaks and fixes, that is how Minetrack sat for the next two years. In fact, there was a total of <strong>5</strong> commits during 2018 and 2019 combined - with 3 being community contributions!</p>
<p><img src="/Minetrack_images/2018_2019_commits.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>What happened? Well, <em>nothing</em>.</p>
<p>Minetrack quietly ran without issue on its tiny $5/month <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/">DigitalOcean droplet</a>, serving its purpose. Focused on <a href="https://hytale.com">Hytale</a>, I had forgotten about Minetrack and considered the project unsupported. It had been abandoned to run as long and as well as it could without intervention.</p>
<p>What was Minetrack doing during this abandonment? Serving terabytes of bandwidth* monthly to thousands of daily visitors. Even abandoned, Minetrack was still useful, which was more than I could have ever expected of it.</p>
<p><em>*Admittedly, some of that bandwidth usage is likely due to its original, unoptimized protocol.</em> üòÑ</p>
<p><strong>So, what&rsquo;s next?</strong></p>
<p>Starting in 2020, several new versions of Minetrack have been released. These updates have focused on patching several long standing bugs, offer a host of optimizations, and a much needed facelift.</p>
<p>You can consider this a spring cleaning. üßπ</p>

</figure>

<p>My goal is to continue shipping some more minor updates focused on user experience improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p>Besides code updates, I&rsquo;ve released over 4 years of Minetrack&rsquo;s databases freely into the public domain at <a href="https://data.minetrack.me/">data.minetrack.me</a>. My hope is to help kick-start some long term analysis of Minecraft&rsquo;s multiplayer player counts.</p>
<p><strong>In summary</strong></p>
<p>Completely against my original expectations, Minetrack has celebrated its 5th birthday and I&rsquo;m excited for its next 5 years. A big thank you to those of you who have helped shaped it over the years.</p>
<p>Finally, an immense level of credit is due to <a href="https://github.com/Cryptkeeper/Minetrack/graphs/contributors">Minetrack&rsquo;s open source contributors</a>, and in particular <a href="https://github.com/hugmanrique">@hugmanrique</a>, who have collectively helped fix bugs, add features, and maintain the project. Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
